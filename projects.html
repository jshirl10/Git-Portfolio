<h1>Projects</h1>
<p> Some Web Design Projects that I am thinking about trying are: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>A workout schedule and place where you can log workouts and set goals</li>
    <li>I have also thought about doing some sort of page to help with budgeting because I am interested in money</li>
    <li>A gospel topics page would also be really cool to do</li>
  </ul>
